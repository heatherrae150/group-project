# Our Brief

Create an application which helps a user find information about a local area.  The user should be able to see different events or venues nearby and save these to look at later.
You might use an API to bring in content or a database to store facts. The topic of the app is your choice.
MVP
•	Display some information about a particular topic in an interesting way
•	Have some user interactivity using event listeners, e.g to move through different sections of content
